Have you noticed that the technology of the world is rapidly growing, we went from horses and buggies in 1890s to super sonic jet airplanes by the 1970s. Since 1970 we've seen a massive increase of technology from airplanes, cars, the internet and medicine. We've got vaccines based off of custom engineered MRNA strands to kill viruses-how neat is that!

Have you lived through history making event, after history making event after history making event? Think about it from an US perspective:
* The attacks on 9/11/2001
* Anthrax and DC Sniper Shooter
* Afghan war
* Iraq wars
* Crash of 2008/2009
* So many school shootings
* First African American President (Obama)
* Covid 19
* Las Vegas Mass shooting, movie theater mass shooting
* 2020 failed insurrection
* 2021 invasion of Ukraine by Russia
* Failed Trump assassination attempt
* Russia moving equipment back to Cuba (Cuban missile crisis all over again?)

I could go on and on. But I won't.

I've been in the closet for a long time, wearing a mask and trying to blend into the crowd at work. Sure I'm a loud spoken person about code quality and technical views. But I've always held my beliefs about sexuality, religion and politics close to the vest.

The world is spinning out of control. From my post above, events are progressing faster and faster, the madness is increasing. It feels like child birth, the contractions between big events are getting shorter.

So many people are getting wrapped up in politics, Donald Trump, oh so and so group hates this other group. All this noise. It's just a distraction.

What do you believe about Jesus Christ?

* Was he a crazy guy with some good moral lessons?
* He's a fairy tale made up by 12 dudes (Like watergate!) -- nothing to see here, lets move along
* He died, Rose in 3 days and is Lord of all creation

# Aren't you freaked out?
No. I'm not afraid. I was in 2020, but so much has changed in my life.

Jesus is coming back again. He said there will be signs (Matthew 24)

Read the words of Jesus, Birth pains, Earth quakes and wars, many will marry and be given in marriage. -- the signs are coming, it seems like we've had enough major news for a life time, and something else major happens.

JESUS IS COMING. He's going to be here soon and the entire world is falling apart.

Jesus said he came to seek and save the lost.

YOU CAN HAVE HOPE AND PEACE. JESUS IS COMING. HE WILL BE HERE SOON.

How can I have hope and peace? By trusting in the Prince of Peace - Jesus Christ

The bible says if you repent, confess with you mouth that "Jesus is Lord" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

# PRAY RIGHT NOW:

“Dear Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner. I believe You died for my sins. Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life. I confess You as my personal Lord and Savior. Thank You for saving me. Amen.”
