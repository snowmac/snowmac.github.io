I've been really blessed. I have had a bunch of short term contracts with this one company. Renewal every 2 weeks, so I was heavily looking for a new job. I interviewed to over 20 companies -- multistep interviews, not counting recruiter calls, all to get to final round or near final round to find out I didn't get the job. I've applied to atleast 1000 jobs in the last few months.

Meanwhile I've picked up a new hobby: dumpster diving. I've dived commercial and retail dumpsters looking for re-sellable items, soon discovering scrap metal and all the beauties of that.

Welp, I scratch out a business plan, form a business card and logo, name the business and decide not to launch it. I was final round at a few companies. In the last week or so, I realized I was going to be unemployed. No clear path to employment.

That stinks. I was down cast 2 weeks ago. What am I doing with my life?

But you know what? This is a time of joy and rejoicing. Why? God has provided me with ideas, motivation and tools at my disposal to go start a company.

Everyday I pray about it and Jesus speaks to my heart. He is going to provide a way. He will open doors if I knock. I will have food on the table. My bills will be paid. My family will be taken care of. Peace. Unending peace. Peace beyond all understanding and reasoning.

I shouldn't feel peace. I have no job. I have a lot of bills. But I also have the maker of heaven and the earth. Jesus. He is my rock and my foundation.

So I'm knocking. I got 500 business cards printed and have already gone through almost 2 inches of cards in networking.

I've bid on 3 trucks on a auction site.

I've reached out to parts of my network letting them know.

I'm still open to work, but if it's not remote, I am not interested.
