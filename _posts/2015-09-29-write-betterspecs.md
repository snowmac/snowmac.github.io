I love RSpec. It&#8217;s one of the best tools on the web for opensource developers to write tests. Nothing compares to its power, ability and extensibility. Mocha and Chai for Javascript pale in comparison to its ability to test.

That said there are some really terrible spec files out there. I&#8217;m wholly grateful for a resource you all must checkout if you write Ruby or RSpec, its called &#8220;BetterSpecs&#8221;. Its a online resource containing examples of bad ideas and examples of better ideas and finally examples of best practices to use when writing RSpec tests.

Check it out, it&#8217;s totally free: <a href="http://betterspecs.org/" target="_blank">http://betterspecs.org/ </a>
