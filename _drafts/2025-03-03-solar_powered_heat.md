It's been almost 9 months since my last post. It has not been for a lack of topics to talk about but rather desire and energy. This originally was going to be all about software and trying to help other people improve their careers, then it became pro dev mentor then a few other things. Now it's back to just a personal blog about things I find interesting. If nobody reads it, that is fine.

Today, we're going to explore a passion project of mine. Independence. I'm an American and Independence is a big thing we're all about. From 1776 and sticking it to the king, to 2024 and sticking it to the establishment, Americans love their favorite idol, Independence. I too, am no exception. That's why I grow a garden, tend my own yard, chop my own firewood and explore alternative energy and what will lead me out of traditional employment.

All that fluff said, I am building a solar powered space heater. I know what you're thinking a 1500 watt space heater run over 2 hours is 3 kwh, and a solar array produces anywhere from 4-8k depending on the system per hour per day. So a good chunk of the power will be going to heat, during the day time when most people don't need it. Thats right, but I'm not going to be building a solar array for eletric to heat. I'm not converting energy from X to Y. I'm transferring it from outside to inside.
