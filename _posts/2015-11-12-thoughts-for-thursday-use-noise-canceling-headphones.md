I recently bought a pair of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWJT1A?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00" target="_blank">Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B</a> from Amazon. They&#8217;re close to $100 but they&#8217;re less then the price of similar Bose headphones.

These headphones are awesome. It&#8217;s active noise canceling so it cancels out white noise. You have no idea what kind of white noise is in your environment until you put one of these things on and turn it on. It&#8217;s amazing! There is no more noise. You can still hear people talk in a muted sense but oh man, these things are awesome.

Once they&#8217;re on, put on some soft music and you&#8217;re in business for concentrationÂ for hours. The only downside is my ears are a little big, so the lobes hurt after about an hour or so. Thats ok by me.
