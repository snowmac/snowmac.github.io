Yesterday & Today I spent a number of hours working on this blog from making videos for a post about dev tools to working on configuring the domain name. I always wanted to use Github Pages, but had a hard time in the past getting the domain to work.

I just wanted to write this brief thank you to Melissa Mcewen for [how to configure the dreamhost domain with Github pages](https://medium.com/@melissamcewen/getting-github-pages-to-work-with-a-dreamhost-domain-5fcefac93063). That was very helpful, thank you!
