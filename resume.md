# Resume

<p>Welcome to my resume page. Here you will find a copy of my resume as a <a href="/assets/resume/AdamBourg.pdf">PDF</a> and a <a href="/assets/resume/AdamBourg.docx">Word</a> document. Why not an HTML version? All good programmers avoid unnecessary work when possible :-)</p>

<p>It's the latest resume, I keep it updated. It's much easier to respond to an email of "Let me see your resume. Sure, here's adambourg.com/resume, then send over a PDF/Word doc, especially on a mobile device.</p>

# Next role / what I'm looking for

I'm a Developer. Pure and simple, I want to be hands on and not in some kind of middle management role. If you have a role that is 80% or more focused on development, architecture, building stuff or tackling technical issues; I'm very interested. If you're looking for a manager to manage a technical team with little to hands on work, lets not waste eachothers time: I'm not interested. 

I don't really want to be a lead. I'm more interested in a senior role with less peopling. I'm not anti social, I'm just not interested in people management. If I were, I would have my MBA in management from my alma mater. 

# Expectations
* I work M-F, 8:30 to 4:30 MST; I don't work weekends, I don't death march. If you do, you can go ahead and close this tab. 
* Wednesday's from 12:00 to 3:30 I volunteer at a local highschool teaching programming. If this is a problem, I'm not interested. 
* $165,000 salary minimum or $100 an hour 1099 or $85 an hour W2 contract
* Remote only -- nothing onsite, no traveling, no first x days / weeks on site to prove myself
