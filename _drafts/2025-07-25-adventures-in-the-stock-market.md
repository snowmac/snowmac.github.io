Over the last 18 months I've liquidated my portfolio and focused in on AI hyper growth plus some gambling in those "hot stock picks" by random people like the Montley Fool. It all started with Nvidia. I saw the block buster it became and I started doing regular volatility trading. Which basically looked at really short term gains, like there were weeks when it would open at $120 and by the end of the week it would close at $130. I would watch and trade heavily with stops and limits and all kinds of automated rules. I made about $6,000 doing that before stopping to just search for unicorns and AI startups.

# Highlights

- Top Performers: AMZN (+122.5%), POET (+60.5%), CPNG, COIN.
- Underperformers: BKYI, MPW, F â€” declines over 45%.
- Some speculative/early-stage names: IMUX, CRWV, RGTI, BZAI show mixed but notable moves.

# Lets talk about the wins

## Amazon

Amazon has been there the longest, more then 3 years. Basically, in June of 2022 they did a 20 to 1 stock split. Right before that I had purchased a few shares, not many. Since them I dumped more money and that normalized $104 has just sat for 3 years. Over the last 3 years the <a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/%5EIXIC?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">NASDAQ</a> has returned an average annulized return of 22.41%. Meaning $1000 in 2022 would be worth about $1224 today. Not bad. That same $1000 in Amazon alone would be worth $2226. A whopping 122% growth over the same period.
