Blog post: you need a new hobby 

Are you a developer? Do you do your full time job then go home only to sit in front of another screen to build code for another 3-6 hours? Does your weekend revolve around Netflix, syfy channel, eating and sleeping? If so, you should consider a new hobby. 

# why hobbies are important 

# what are my hobbies?

I’m sort of an interesting creature, one weekend I’m desiring pampering: massages, hair and toes done and the next I’m under my car drenched in sweat trying to fix a problem. This weekend was a car weekend. I woke up egar to work on my brake system. This is the first time on my Subaru and first solo brake job. I awoke early, 7 am. Then by 8 I was originized and had the car jacked up. 

I spent the day with my wife and 10 month old baby hanging out in the garage then in the other car back into the garage. It was an awesome day. 

Hobbies that aren’t technical are great because it exercises different parts of your brain and body. In the case of working on my car, I’m working all my muscles, patience and my language filter; my mind is thinking about problems in the physical space. Not to mention I’m hot, sweaty and drinking a ton of water. 

This is good because I’m in a chair most of my life: it gives me a different perspective.
