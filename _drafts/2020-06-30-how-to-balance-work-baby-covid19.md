Luke is my son, he's 11 months old and he's a bundle of crazy, silly, high energy joy. I'm a unique Dad, due not to Covid 19 but to choice, I'm a work from home Dad with a 11 month old baby. Precovid my wife did not work from home (she's a teacher), now she had to until summer vacation. If you're a parent who choses to work from home and raise your kid, I'm going to share my tips for how to make it happen. 

# Get used to their favorite place to nap 

Our son is not a crib napper; though we're working on this skill, he's only good for about 30 minutes in the crib. I'm writing this in 95 degree weather, idiling at my local Panera for the last 90 minutes (I'm killing the earth apparently by burning gas....) my AC is on and Rafi is on the car's radio. Luke is fun, but during COVID this kid still wants to sleep in the car; so I typically go for a 1-3 hour car ride to get him down. Typically though he will go down withing 20 minutes and stay down for 1-2 hours enough time to get a lot of work busted out. 

# Embrace the morning

Luke will wake up at 5 am or 7 am. Most days he's pretty regular about 7 am, to the point where I stopped setting an alarm. When he cries, I wake up and tend to his needs. When he wakes up in the morning after 4 am he just wants to go back to sleep. This is the perfect time to hold/cuddle the little guy, then once he's asleep break out the laptop for an hour or so's worth of work.
