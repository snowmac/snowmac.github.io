What is the number 1 way you can stand out as a developer? Sure you can have a really awesome Github with tons of code contributed, but if I’m in HR do I really care or understand that you’ve written significant parts of Ruby core? Probably not. That’s why you need to checkout this really awesome guy, John Sonmez, over at Simple Programmer.

John has been producing a ton of great content for about 4 years, he has a really cool FREE email course on how to build your brand and standout from the crowd by regularly blogging.

The website to this free course is: [http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/?__s=gpzepouf5ouejifmuhcd)

This is a great deal, honestly until Hacker News posted one of his articles a few months ago this guy was totally a no name to me. But this guy is legit, he has really great content and articles going back many years.
