# Resume

<p>Welcome to my resume page. Here you will find a copy of my resume as a <a href="/assets/resume/AdamBourg.pdf">PDF</a> and a <a href="/assets/resume/AdamBourg.docx">Word</a> document. Why not an HTML version? All good programmers avoid unnecessary work when possible :-)</p>

<p>It's the latest resume, I keep it updated. It's much easier to respond to an email of "Let me see your resume. Sure, here's adambourg.com/resume", then send over a PDF/Word doc, especially on a mobile device.</p>

# Next role / what I'm looking for

I'm a Developer. Pure and simple, I want to be hands on and not in some kind of middle management role. If you have a role that is 80% or more focused on development, architecture, building stuff or tackling technical issues; I'm very interested. If you're looking for a manager to manage a technical team with little to no hands on work: I'm not interested. 

# Tech Stack 
* Currently on NodeJS and React
* Have worked with Apollo, Typescript and MongoDB
* Extensive PostgresSQL experience
* Would be open to a Rails and Ruby role (5 years experience, 5 years ago) 
* Really strong in CSS, SQL and HTML 
* Worked with Azure & AWS
* Not really a kuberentes or docker guy; I've used docker, but I haven't set that stuff up before
* Open to working on other languages and tech stacks such as Python, Java, Elixir etc... 
* I'm a Unix / Linux / Mac guy; I don't do any development on Windows 

# Expectations
* I work M-F, normal business hours; I don't work weekends, I don't death march. If you do, you can go ahead and close this tab. 
* I pick have to leave to get my kid from school around 2:45-3, then I'm typically back online not long after that 
* Remote -- nothing onsite, no traveling, no first x days / weeks on site to prove myself
* Hybrid -- I will consider a hybrid role in the Denver market- but I gotta still be able to work from the coffee shop or the mountains!
