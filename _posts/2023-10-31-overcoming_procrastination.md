I'm terrible at procrastination, actually, no I am really talented at procrastination. I'm the best procrastinator I know. I'm very effective at putting nearly everything off. License plate renewal? No problem, see you in 6 months? Fines? What, I'm paying the stupid bill! Late fees? Thank goodness everything is on auto pay. I'm a very talented and yet accomplished procrastinator. I have a really hard time getting started so much that I will put off doing simple things, for hours or days. But I've discovered some language around this that helps me and some techniques that might help you. 

# Task initiation

The biggest reason I procrastinate is not that I want to get started or that I don't want to do the task, it's I don't know where or how to get started. Example my house was very messy yesterday, I had 3 dishwasher cycles full of dishes and a 1700 sq ft floor to mop, dinner to cook and more. What did I do? I was driving home and I broke the tasks down into <strong>small, managable tasks</strong> such as I need to empty the dish washer by putting the cups away then I could scrub and load the plates. 

With my work, it really helps to break things down barney style and think about the first, next thing I need to do, because once I unjam the log, I break the dam and I can work. For example, I'm currently working on a user story, the first thing I should do to get started is to review the UI and create the UI component then get that page to load with a simple "hello world", this is enough of a small task that I've set aside my procranstination so I can get started. 

# Timers force the issue 

By using a 25 minute timer, I create pressure to start the task. I have a single task in mind, the task I need to do. Build the UI component, empty the dish washer. It's this single action that gets the ball rolling. For example, I wanted to do a blog post today but I was procrastinating because I wasn't sure what to write, so I picked this topic. 

When the timer rings, I ignore it and keep going. I don't like stopping. 

# Give yourself a small deadline

Get an idea of what an end state looks like for the end of the project that you can achieve today and then give yourself that deadline. Ok by 5 pm today, I will have a new UI built that you can navigate to, with a basic save feature created. Ok, it's 9 am when I'm setting this goal, I should be able to attain this. Or with household chorse, I say I'm giving 1 hour of energy; in that I will do the dishes and wipe the counter down. Once momentum gets started, I find stopping hard.
