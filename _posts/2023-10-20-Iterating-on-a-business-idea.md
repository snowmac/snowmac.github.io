I’m a man of many, many, many ideas. I have a long list and a variety of interests. I’ve always wanted to start and more importantly run a successful small business. To build a product, get it to market and run with it. I’ve been apart of a few consultancy companies and a few <a href="http://www.adambourg.com/startups/work/life/lessons/learned/2023/09/06/Adventures-in-startups.html">unsuccessful</a> start ups.

I thought it would be helpful to list out all the possible business models and some possible businesses within each category. Here’s the list:

- Software as a service
- Market Place Plugins
- Platform as a service
- Software for a license fee
- Free software, paid support
- Courses and training
- Affiliate Programs
- Custom web design and development
- Hourly contracting
- Full time jobs
- You tube channels and other video channels
- Pod casting
- Consulting
- Lead generation landing pages
- Web asset development: libraries like AG Grid, Web Templates, etc..

# Software as a service

The dream of many engineers. To build a web application and sell it, from Slack, to New Relic, to Salesforce. Billions are made here. Competition is fierce. There are even micro SAAS applications, like <a href="https://www.recipal.com" target="_blank">ReciPal</a> for nutrition labels.

# Market Place Plugins

Services like Shopify allow you to build applications that run on their platform that end users can install.

# Platform as a service

Platforms like Heroku and AWS offer cloud-based environments for developers to build, deploy, and scale applications. You could create a specialized platform catering to a specific industry, like a healthcare data management platform.

# Software for a license fee

Building something like graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator or 1Password, licensing it for a one-time fee. Users would pay upfront for the software and have access to it indefinitely.

# Free software, paid support

Develop an open-source project, like a content management system, and offer premium support plans. Users can access the basic version for free, but can opt for paid support for more advanced features and assistance.

# Courses and training

Create an online learning platform focused on a niche skill, such as a platform for learning data science or a specialized language learning app like Duolingo.

# Affiliate Programs

Start a blog or website focused on a specific niche (e.g., outdoor gear), and earn commissions by promoting products from affiliate partners. For instance, reviewing and promoting hiking equipment with links to purchase on Amazon.

# Custom web design and development

Offer bespoke web development services, catering to specific industries or functionalities. For example, specializing in e-commerce platforms with custom integrations.

# Hourly contracting

Provide specialized services on an hourly basis, such as legal consulting or graphic design work for marketing agencies.

# Full time jobs

Consider creating a recruitment platform focused on a specific industry, connecting skilled professionals with job opportunities. Or just obtaining a full time job, or two, or three (some developers do that, shhh!).

# YouTube channels and other video channels

Start a YouTube channel dedicated to a particular genre, like AI Prompt Engineering, and generate income through ad revenue and sponsorships.

# Podcasting

Create a podcast series about personal finance for engineerings, and monetize it through sponsorships, premium content, or merchandise sales.

# Consulting

Offer expert advice in a specific field, like web performance consulting for e-commerce businesses.

# Lead generation landing pages

Design and sell high-converting landing pages tailored for specific industries, such as real estate lead generation pages.

# Web asset development: libraries like AG Grid, Web Templates, etc.

Develop and sell premium web development libraries, like a high-performance grid system (similar to AG Grid) or customizable web templates for specific content management systems.
