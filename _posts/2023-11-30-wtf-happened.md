I was saving my last post, the one about ChatGPT saving my butt and something weird happened. I acceidentally pressed a bunch of keys including the period ".", and it launched a browser version of VS code. .... I'm like WTF Github. Anyways it even changed my url to Github.dev instead of .com. Well, read the <a href="https://github.com/github/dev" target="_blank">Docs</a>. Because this a legit Github feature. Pretty neat and totally unexpected. Apparently this window allows you to edit code, install extensions and more. This is so cool and totally unexpected!
