# Resume

<p>Welcome to my resume page. Here you will find a copy of my resume as a <a href="/assets/resume/AdamBourg.pdf">PDF</a> and a <a href="/assets/resume/AdamBourg.docx">Word</a> document. Why not an HTML version? All good programmers avoid unnecessary work when possible :-)</p>

<p>It's the latest resume, I keep it updated. It's much easier to respond to an email of "Let me see your resume. Sure, here's adambourg.com/resume.html, then send over a PDF/Word doc, especially on a mobile device.</p>
