# You know me, can I really be an engineer?

A friend of mine recently got in touch with me, I was catching up with him and we were talking about our lives and careers. He's struggling to make a living without much clear direction, I suggested he should become an engineer becasue the starting salaries are really good and you can build cool stuff. He's a creative so it makes a lot of sense. 

He posed the above question to me. I answered, with a question: 

```
Suppose Santiago was a shepherd. He sold a bunch of his sheep to his friend, then he sold, 10% of his flock, 6 sheep to a merchant in town. He took the proceeds to travel a journey to find a lost treasure near the pyramids of Egypt.
```

Yes, that is Santiago from the Alchemist. This is a basic word problem, to solve it, you need to use basic Algebra. 


```math 
Y is the size of the flock
y * .1 = 6

X is the number of sheep he sold to his friend
y - 6 = x 
```

Y is the flock size, .1 is 10% in decimal form and 6 are the number of sheep that Santiago already has. It becomes a simple problem from here: 

```math
y * .1 = 6
(y * .1)/.1 = 6/.1
y = 6/.1
y = 60

His flock was 60 sheep

y - 6 = x
60-6 = x
54 = x 

He sold 54 sheep to his friend
```

I told him, if you can solve that problem, you can be an engineer. Why?

# Why you can be an software engineer

I argue that if you can solve the above problem you have the basic skills to move from joe plubmer to joe programmer. Here's why: 

1. Solving word problems are a lot like solving real business problems. You need to anaylize the problem and determine some kind of out come. It's logical, step by step, algorithmic thinking. 
2.
