This is a long over due post. I had many hopes for Pro Dev Mentor. I had many plans of what I was going to say, sell and do. But then I lost my job then was thrown into the world of consulting. I spent 50-60 hours a week for a solid year developing software to manage software. It felt recursive. Then this blog really took a back seat. I've let AdamBourg.com and Prodevmentor.com sit, Pro dev has expired and my own site has site idle for years. It's a waste really. 

I've been thinking a lot of how much I hate Wordpress, hate manual deployments for jeykll and most of all how I want something simple that lets me write without technology getting in the way. I chose Github pages with my own domain; killing the bluehost bill in the process. Github also has the ability from any browser to write in mark down and create a file. Therefore I can blog anywhere and everywhere. 

All has not been bad however. My wife and I had our first baby in 2019; born in July. Luke has changed me forever. He has changed my perspective on work and what I want in life. In so many good ways. I've lost thousands of hours of productivity and sleep through endless carrides and countless, sleepless nights rocking him to sleep. It has been SO worth it. 

What's the plan for this blog? Well, I'm glad you asked.

My friend Abdul teaches at a for profit coding school; through that I have been a guest speaker on career development and interviewing. That has awaken my need to share, blog and give back. My goal with this blog, is to be consistent in publishing good material. I want to self publish a book or video series on Javascript Memory Management; talking about the differences of the Chrome Engine vs Trident vs NodeJS. How we can optimize memory. Things like that. I also want to blog on data structures and algrothims; finally career and a few personal topics as well. 

My promise to you and to myself is that I'm not going to focus on building an audience or any crap like that, I'm going to write the best content I can and publish often. 

See you soon 


Adam
