I was reading hacker news at lunch today and I came across a really cool feature of browsers that Mozilla and Chrome have been rolling out, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Houdini" target="_blank">CSS Houdini</a>. Basically it exposes some rendering engine APIs that allow you to do amazing things using Javascript, web components and css. Its really amazing and you need to checkout the video below.

If you're as excited about this as I am, checkout <a href="Houdini.how" target="_blank">Houdini.how</a> for some really amazing examples!
