Welcome! I'm glad you're here. Linkedin restricts messages to 300 characters and I have more than that I want to say here. 

If you're a recruiter please proceed. If you're a financial advisor or someone selling me a product, I kindly ask you to please leave me alone. 

# Recruiters 

Thanks so much for reaching out. I’m always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. As a software engineer I’m sure you can imagine that I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn. It is a wonderful position of privilege to be in and I’m thankful for it.

It does however mean that I don’t have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I’d like to level set around the level of seniority that you’re looking for. 
Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you’re reaching out in reference to? 
While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.
In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.
Thanks again for reaching out!
 
I look forward to hearing from you.

# What do I want in my next job? 

Well, it depends. For me it really boils down to: 

1. Remote only roles. Part time on site, 3 days a week from home etc... no thank you. I work from home or from a hotel when traveling. If it's not remote, please don't reach out. 
2. Full time or Contract. Tell me up front. 
3. Disclosure of rate. If it's contract, give me your C2C/1099 rate if it's a salary give me the full range. If you don't like it, I'm very sorry but it is now <a href="https://www.laboremploymentlawblog.com/2020/12/articles/bonus-compensation/colorado-new-equal-pay-act/" target="_blank">Colorado State Law</a>. 
4. Short interview process. If you have 6 interviews, a bunch of take home work and other crap; I'm not interested. 
5. Autonomy of schedule. I have Therapy at 9 am on Thursdays and I teach a computer programming class at a local highschool as a volunteer Wednesday afternoons. Neither is negotiable. I need therapy and to teach kids to program. 
6. Equity, Options or RSUs -- I need and want skin in the business.
