What if I told you that you could get free fuel for the next two months? What if this deal was better then getting a fuel discount at the pump? What if I told you this is better then pumping red bull into your blood stream?

Well my friend, I'd be right, I'd be a happy, enthusiastic man. This is not a paid advertisement. This is a post about Panera, they're offing <a href="https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html?ref=COFFEEe3af71">free Coffee until September 7, 2020</a>. Every developer, recruiter and project manager reading this needs the free fuel. After the 7th it's $9 a month. As a loyal Panera drinker; this stuff is legit. I've had it since March. I LOVE the free, unlimited coffee, tea or ice coffee. 

# UNLIMITED? FOR REAL?

Get any size, any flavor once up to every 2 hours, with unlimited refills while youâ€™re in the cafe. That means plenty of coffee to pair with your favorite bagel, breakfast sandwich, or sweet treat.

# HOW DO I GET MY COFFEE?

Order a hot coffee, iced coffee or hot tea as usual at the cafe, online or in our app. Pretty easy, huh?

Alright, that's enough spam for one day. Back to regular javascript programming.....
