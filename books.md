I'm an avid reader, though most of my reading focuses on fiction I do have a number of non-fiction books I highly recommend to anyone looking to learn and grow their career and personal development. 

How do you read so much? I often get this question. There are two pieces to it, if there's a really good book I want to read, I will first check my library's digital audiobook collection, if it's not available and I have to read it, then I checkout Audible. The nice thing about the library is I can get 10 digital copies a month and I have the 2 credit a month Audible membership. 

I recommend Audio books over visual reading whenever possible for fiction. Non fiction, I actually tend to read faster when not listening but visually reading. It's strange I know.
