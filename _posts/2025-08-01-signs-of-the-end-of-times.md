Here are 10 reasons why I believe we are the last generation on earth before the tribulation. We are living in the last days, it's time to pick up your bibles and find people who don't know Jesus and mobilize. It's time to get uncomfortable and preach the gospel. This world needs to know the hope and love of Jesus before it's to late. This month, I'm going to do just that, take my bible and get infront of as many people as I can. Time is short. He is coming. Jesus is nearly here.

# Increased weather disturbances

> Matthew 24:7 - For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.

Some people would say an increase in natural disasters is due to climate change, not the warning of the coming of Jesus. See Matthew 24 where Jesus talks about increased weather events, wars and rumors of wars. For example this past week a 8 magnitude earthquake was experienced off the coast of Russia up near Alaska and that had a tsunami warning effecting Japan, Hawaii, California and Alaska.

Earthquakes this week is only one measure of the increase, look at the charts below that encompass all natural disasters.

# Increase of wars

> Matthew 24:6 - You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.

One study, recently <a href="https://www.prio.org/news/3616#:~:text=2024%20marked%20a%20grim%20new,spike%20–%20it's%20a%20structural%20shift" target="_blank">published by the peace institute of Oslo</a> stated in June 2025, points to a significant increase in the number of conflicts around the world, the world is far more violent and far more fragmented, then it was a decade ago.

# Increase of pestilences (or Epidemics)

> Matthew 24:7 - For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.

The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9175207/" target="_blank">National Institute of Health</a> points out that in the last century that due to factors like global travel, urbanization and “climate change”, that the world is seeing a large spike in epidemics and pandemics compared the centuries of old.

The <a href="https://www.txbiomed.org/news-press/news/infectious-diseases-are-on-the-rise/" target="_blank">WHO reports</a> that 30 new diseases have emerged in the last 20 years.

<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4223919/" target="_blank">NIST also reports</a> from 1980-2013 there was a rise of epidemics by 250%.

# Increase of earthquakes

<a href="https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes.html" target="_blank">52,000 earthquakes in the last 30 days</a>

> Matthew 24:7 - For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.

I normalized the data to represent earthquakes of 4.0 or greater, to account for an increase in sensitivity of measuring equipment.

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Time Period</th>
      <th>Total Number of Quakes ≥ 4.0</th>
      <th>Per Day</th>
      <th>Source</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>30 days</td>
      <td>1986</td>
      <td>66</td>
      <td><a href="https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes.html" target="_blank">Volcano Discovery</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10–20 years</td>
      <td>13,000 to 15,000</td>
      <td>35–55</td>
      <td><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/lists-maps-and-statistics" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey – Lists, Maps, and Statistics</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

We can see that over the last 30 days we have had 66 earth quakes compared to an average range of 35-55 per day for the last 20 years. This is an increase of atleast 120% up to 180%.

# Increase of false teaching

> 1 Timothy 4:1 - Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons.

Look at scientology as one false religion. Science, technology and aliens? What a combo. What about Agnosticism and atheism? Those are among the rise in America. People are embracing several false teachings:

- Jesus was a good teacher but not the son of God
- God doesn't exist
- The universe is god
- Jesus was a really nice guy that loved everyone and wants everyone to be nice

What is Jesus? He's not a dead king on a cross. He's the only way to God, the only hope and salvation. He is the way the truth and the life.

# People will be lovers of themselves, money, abusive

> 2 Timothy 3:2 - People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,

People love money, is that a surprise? Look at instagram, people are boasting of their latest gear, toys, trips and jobs. They're proud of how different they are, or how successful they are. "Let your freak flag fly!". Just look at abusive, the rise of the 50 shades of gray and the obession with BDSM? From kink and leather festivals in San Francisco, to men dragging other men on leashes around Key West. Kink and bondage is in. They're loud and proud about their whips, their chains and their sin.

# Without love, brutal

> 2 Timothy 3:3 - without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,

Abortion anyone? Since Roe vs wade was overturned just a few years ago, banning abortions in many states, it's still on the rise. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/abortions-data-since-roe-wade" target="_blank">An 8% rise in abortions</a> from 2023 to 2024 -- a total of 1,140,000 babies were murdered in <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/despite-bans-number-abortions-united-states-increased-2023#:~:text=New%20findings%20from%20the%20Monthly,States%20in%20over%20a%20decade." target="_blank">2024</a> alone.

Millions of children have been murdered by abortionists since Roe V. Wade, over 60 million since the court case. 60 million babies since 1973. About 1.2 million babies murdered every year.

> Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molek, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the Lord.

> Leviticus 20:2-5 - “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him. I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Molek, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Molek and if they fail to put him to death, I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molek.’”

> Proverbs 6:17 -

# Lovers of pleasure

> 2 Timothy 3:4 - treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—

Porn is so easy to get ahold of. It's everywhere. People love using porn all the time. It's one of the biggest sources of traffic on the internet and one of the most common vices among all genders.

It's not just sex, but food, we're the fattest and heavist generation of all time. What did Satan tempt eve with? It was a piece of food with the lie that you would become like God. She desired to eat it. And so have so many Americans desired to eat just about everything.

# Israel became a nation on May 14, 1948

> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066%3A7-9&version=TLB" target="_blank">Isaiah 66:8</a> - Who has heard or seen anything as strange as this? For in one day, suddenly, a nation, Israel, shall be born, even before the birth pains come. In a moment, just as Israel’s anguish starts, the baby is born; the nation begins.

Interesting, if you look at the data before, a lot of natural disasters really started to spike after 1950s. Interesting timing? I think not. Israel suddenly becoming a nation once again? It's been over 1000 years, why does Israel need to exist again? Why do the Jews need their homeland back? Well, God made them a promise and our God keeps his promises.

Notice that a nation was born before th BIRTH PAINs, the same thing spoken about in Matthew 24. These are the birth pains as a sign to the end.

# Knowledge and travel will increase

> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012%3A3-5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Daniel 12:4</a> - But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.

**Travel**

Daniel 12 is speaking about the end times, and in this specific passages it highlights two important ideas. Travel will be wide spread and knowledge will increase.

Many people say that we're approaching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity" target="_blank">singularity</a> where our technology and understanding expands beyond our current understanding to a new unknown.

If you look back before 1900, humans had 4 modes of travel:

1. Your feet or someone else's feet
2. Horses / Horse and Buggy
3. Boats or ships
4. Trains

To cross America by train in 1900, it would take about <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-did-it-take-to-cross-America-by-train-in-1900" target="_blank">7 days</a>.

To cross America by airplane in 2025, it could take less then 12 hours including time to stop at airport security. A New York City flight to Los Angeles is about 6 hours. New York to Rome is a 8 hour non stop flight.

**Knowledge**

Currently the world has atleast <a href="a" target="blank">149</a> zettabytes on the internet. 1 zettabyte is 1000 terabytes. <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-data-explained-how-much-were-producing-and-where-its-all-stored-159964" target="_blank">Humans achieved more technological development in the past 150 years than during the previous 2,000 years.</a>

In 2023, Our world in data <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/technology-long-run" target="blank">published the below info graphic</a> about how much data has changed over the last 150 years. They said: "One insight I take away from this long-term perspective is how unusual our time is. Technological change was extremely slow in the past"

Just look at AI -- that will be a seperate post.

# Does this scare you?

If you're a Christian, fear not for our redemption is near as the bible says. If you don't know Jesus, then it's time to learn about Jesus. It's time you got saved.

Don't be a fool-- get saved before it's to late.

# How can I be saved?

This is pulled from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/how-can-I-be-saved.html" target="_blank">https://www.gotquestions.org/how-can-I-be-saved.html</a>

This simple, yet profound, question is the most important question that can be asked. "How can I be saved?" deals with where we will spend eternity after our lives in this world are over. There is no more important issue than our eternal destiny. Thankfully, the Bible is abundantly clear on how a person can be saved. The Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30). Paul and Silas responded, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31).

<strong>How can I be saved? Why do I need to be saved?</strong><br/>
We are all infected with sin (Romans 3:23). We are born with sin (Psalm 51:5), and we all personally choose to sin (Ecclesiastes 7:20; 1 John 1:8). Sin is what makes us unsaved. Sin is what separates us from God. Sin is what has us on the path to eternal destruction.

<strong>How can I be saved? Saved from what?</strong><br/>
Because of our sin, we all deserve death (Romans 6:23). While the physical consequence of sin is physical death, that is not the only kind of death that results from sin. All sin is ultimately committed against an eternal and infinite God (Psalm 51:4). Because of that, the just penalty for our sin is also eternal and infinite. What we need to be saved from is eternal destruction (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 20:15).

<strong>How can I be saved? How did God provide salvation?</strong> <br/>
Because the just penalty for sin is infinite and eternal, only God could pay the penalty, because only He is infinite and eternal. But God, in His divine nature, could not die. So God became a human being in the person of Jesus Christ. God took on human flesh, lived among us, and taught us. When the people rejected Him and His message, and sought to kill Him, He willingly sacrificed Himself for us, allowing Himself to be crucified (John 10:15). Because Jesus Christ was human, He could die; and because Jesus Christ was God, His death had an eternal and infinite value. Jesus’ death on the cross was the perfect and complete payment for our sin (1 John 2:2). He took the consequences we deserved. Jesus’ resurrection from the dead demonstrated that His death was indeed the perfectly sufficient sacrifice for sin.

<strong>How can I be saved? What do I need to do?</strong> <br/>
“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31). God has already done all of the work. All you must do is receive, in faith, the salvation God offers (Ephesians 2:8-9). Fully trust in Jesus alone as the payment for your sins. Believe in Him, and you will not perish (John 3:16). God is offering you salvation as a gift. All you have to do is accept it. Jesus is the way of salvation (John 14:6).
