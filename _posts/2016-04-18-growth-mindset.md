My wife is a public school teacher, she teaches students who have special needs. She teaches a lot of students with learning disabilities and one thing she focuses with her students on a concept called &#8220;Growth Mindset&#8221;.

## What is Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset?

The concept is there are two mindsets in people in learning and life. Growth vs Fixed Mindset. Growth says, I don&#8217;t know right now. Where as fixed says I will never know. Fixed mindset says nothing will change, that I can&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t and I&#8217;ll never. Whereas Growth Mindset says: right now, I can&#8217;t, but I will. Even though I&#8217;m frustrated, I will keep trying.

## What is the number one factor in success?

If you look across the dozens of highly successful people, they all took <a href="http://www.entrepreneurshipinabox.com/852/entrepreneurial-success-factors/" target="_blank">action</a>. They pushed themselves and they changed the world. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk (Tesla, Solar City, Paypal) and others like JD Rockefeller, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford#Career" target="_blank">Henry Ford</a>.

If you read about Henry Ford and the Ford Motor company, Ford was born out of the experiments and side projects of an engineer. He &#8220;played&#8221; with gas engines, he had many successes and failures. But what is clear, it&#8217;s the act of trying, of pushing yourself and doing that is a better determining factor rather then intelligenceÂ alone.

## How can I apply growth mindset to my career?

What areas do you lack or struggle in? Do you suck at or hate office politics? So do I, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m reading Harvard Business review on politics. That&#8217;s why I tutor on the side, thats why I am learning Elixir. What are my gaps in my own knowledge? We, functional programming and distributed systems.

## How can I apply growth mindset to my life?

It starts with an attitude or a world view change: I can, I am able, I&#8217;m going to keep trying. It&#8217;s just like practicing an instrument. You&#8217;re working at getting better. I applied growth mindset to the first 10 times I went skiing. Every time I fell down I laughed, cussed and got backup and gave it another try. Now, I can ski almost all day without falling over, I can do a mixture of blues and blacks. I push myself and if I fail, I don&#8217;t give up.
