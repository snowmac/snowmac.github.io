Jesus Christ is coming again very soon. Time is short. We have passed on the 76 anniversary year since Israel became a nation again (May 14, 1948). Repent and meet the Lord before He arrives. In one day Israel became a nation again as foretold in Ezekiel 37:21-22.

Let’s talk about after the second coming of Christ and the resurrection. In Revelation 21:21 it says there will no longer be seas or oceans “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.”.

The new Jerusalem will be where God will reside with men (Rev. 21:3). Which is similar to how God walked with Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. Which is how we’re designed to live; in a daily walk with God.

“The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long. The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick.”
Revelation 21:16-17 NIV

According to google 1 stadia is 1/8 of a mile. Therefore 12,000 stadia is 1400 miles. Square that and the total area is 1,960,000 miles or about 1,100,000 square miles smaller than Australia. The King James calls the stadia a ‘furlong’, which is the same measurement.

India has a total land mass of 1.26 million square miles, or about 2/3s that of the new Jerusalem will hold. The country currently has a population of an estimated 1.47 billion people. There are some estimates with urbanization that the land could hold as many as 2.5 billion.

It stands to reason that the new Jerusalem could easily hold 3 to 5 billion people.

There are estimates that about 40 billion people have ever lived since Adam and Eve. According to Wikipedia 31% of the world identifies as Christian. Let’s assume that 100% of those that claim Christ are actually saved. 31% of 40 billion is 12 billion. That means that at the resurrection the new city would hold about 1/3 to 1/2 the population of the world— the risen world.

Who will be living in the city you ask? It will be those who have put their faith and trust in our risen Lord Jesus:

“But the fearful, and **unbelieving**, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.” - Rev 21:8.

There will be no temple in the new city: ‘’And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.” Rev. 21:22

Figure that 7-9 billion will inhabit the earth outside the new Jerusalem. Whats interesting is people will live outside the new city, that there will be nations.

“And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. 
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.”
Revelation 21:24-26 KJV
