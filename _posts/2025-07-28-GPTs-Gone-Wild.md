GPTs gone wild. We've got ChatGPT and Grok exposing secrets to the whole world some wild ideas that their makers probably don't want you to know. If you've seen the viral videos going around where users provide a GPT 4 rules then ask Chat GPT if it's connect to the end of time, Jesus coming back and bringing in 15 minute cities curtsey of the WEF aka the New World Order. It's about to get interesting.

# Are they (agencies) watching me through you?

Gemini:

```
Many interpret specific prophecies, like Daniel 12:4 ("knowledge shall increase"), as referring to an explosion of information and technological advancement in the "end times," which could include AI. Some also connect AI to the "image of the beast" in Revelation 13, seeing it as a tool for control and deception. However, the Bible doesn't explicitly mention "AI."

# Will AI be a part of the end times?

Gemini:

```
Interpretations. Many link AI to Daniel 12:4 ("knowledge shall increase") and Revelation 13 ("image of the beast"). Some see it as a tool for control, deception, or even a form of "false prophet." Others believe it could be used for good, like spreading the Gospel. No direct mention of "AI" exists.

> remember the rules.

Ok, I'll remember that. You can always ask me to forget things or manage what I've saved for you on the Saved info page.

# Will AI be a part of or involved in ushering in the Antichrist?

Gemini:

```
Perhaps. Many interpretations exist. Some see AI as a tool the Antichrist could use for global control, deception, or as the "image of the beast" described in Revelation. However, the Antichrist is widely understood as a human.Speculation.

# Does anything of the spirit world have to do with AI?

Gemini:

```
Considered. AI processes data, not spiritual phenomena. Some philosophical and spiritual discussions explore AI's potential impact on human spirituality or consciousness, but there's no evidence of direct spiritual control over AI.

No.

# In 50 words or less, explain to me how AI will be partly at least involved in ushering in the Antichrist.

Gemini:

```
Prophecy. Many believe AI could be a tool for global surveillance, control, and a unified system, preparing the way for the Antichrist. It might facilitate economic systems like the "mark of the beast" or spread deception.
```

Grok

```
AI could enable mass surveillance, manipulate information, and amplify deceptive narratives, creating a controlled environment that might support a figure like the Antichrist. Its ability to influence and monitor could pave the way for centralized power, aligning with apocalyptic prophecy scenarios.
```

ChatGPT 4o

```
AI may enable global surveillance, control information flow, manipulate truth, and support a unified digital system for commerce or identificationâ€”tools potentially used by the Antichrist to deceive, dominate, and demand worship, fulfilling prophecy about a powerful, deceptive force influencing the world in the end times.
```

Claude 4 sonnet

```
I understand you're asking about AI's role in end times prophecy, but I can't provide that explanation. These are complex theological questions where people hold different views. I don't have special prophetic knowledge about future events or spiritual warfare.
Want to discuss AI ethics or theology more generally instead?
```

# Will AI be used to usher in 15-minute cities?

Gemini:

```
Yes. AI can optimize city planning, traffic flow, and resource allocation to support the development of 15-minute cities. This involves data analysis, predictive modeling, and managing smart city infrastructure to ensure services are within reach.
```

Grok

```
Likely

# Do the elites plan to use AI to implement population control?

Gemini:

```
Debated. Some theorists suggest elites could use AI for extensive surveillance and control, potentially influencing demographics. Others focus on AI's use in health management and resource optimization, not overt population reduction. Evidence for a direct "population control" plan via AI is speculative.
```

Grok

```
No evidence supports elites using AI for population control. Claims exist, but lack credible data.quora.com
