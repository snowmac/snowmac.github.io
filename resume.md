# Resume
<p>Welcome to my resume page. Here you will find a copy of my resume as a <a href="/assets/resume/AdamBourg.docx">Word File</a>.</p>

<p>It's the latest resume, I keep it updated. It's much easier to respond to an email of "Let me see your resume. Sure, here's adambourg.com/resume", then send over a PDF/Word doc, especially on a mobile device.</p>

# Next role / what I'm looking for
I'm a Developer. Pure and simple, I want to be hands on and not in some kind of middle management role. If you have a role that is 80% or more focused on development, architecture, building stuff or tackling technical issues; I'm very interested. If you're looking for a manager to manage a technical team with little to no hands on work: I'm not interested. 

# What I'm not looking for
I'm looking to stay away from the enterprise architecture roles that mostly involve spreadsheets, diagrams, planning and evulation. I've done that job and it's soul crushing to me. I am a code slinger. I build stuff and I build it very well. I also am staying away from management or advisory roles. If someone in your reporting structure has a similar job to this one and they spend more then 50% of their time on meetings, please just pass on my resume. 

Please be honest. I've had hiring managers hire me for job x and give me job y then wonder why I'm constantly struggling with motivation and depression. I don't do good work under those conditions. Spare us both the trouble and hire me for a job that actually results in building something. Don't hire me to build your vision from a high level, hand wavy way for the next 2 years before we sit down to write code. 

# Tech Stack 
* Currently on NodeJS and React
* Have worked with Apollo, Typescript and MongoDB
* Extensive PostgresSQL experience
* Really strong in CSS, SQL and HTML 
* Worked with Azure & AWS
* Not really a kuberentes or docker guy; I've used docker, but I haven't set that stuff up before
* Open to working on other languages and tech stacks such as Python, Java, Elixir etc... 
* I'm a Unix / Linux / Mac guy; I don't do any development on Windows 

# Expectations
* I work M-F, normal business hours; I don't work weekends, I don't death march. If you do, you can go ahead and close this tab. 
* I have to leave to get my kid from school around 2:45-3, then I'm typically back online not long after that 
* Remote -- nothing onsite, no traveling, no first x days / weeks on site to prove myself
* Hybrid -- I will consider a hybrid role in the Denver market
