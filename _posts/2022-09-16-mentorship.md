I want you to meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roc-taylor/" target="_blank">Roc</a>. He's my new friend and mentee, I found him through a semi virual LinkedIn Post and I told him to reach out to me. I was surprised when he did. He needs a job and a friend, I'm coaching him on what he should focus in and learn for his first job post bootcamp. If you want to hire him, please do. 

He posted this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6970811658537504768/" target="_blank">message on Linkedin</a> when I found him:

I messaged a Senior Engineer about some advise today, they replied...

That I was too old at 47, and that old people can't focus to be developers.
I thanked them for their time and removed them as a connection

Senior is not just a technical term.
It is a term that is used across various industries to not only convey technical ability, but also leadership.
Though the second seems to have missed Tech in many instances

What this 'younger' person failed to realize is us 'Older' f#$%rs have whole lives, careers and experiences that we have lived.


I have walked on the bottom of the sea and I can fly helicopters.
Learning how to push buttons in a formatted context to deliver a desired output isn't going to kill you, and it's not even that hard once you figure it out:)

As a badass, he has walked on the bottom of the sea, apparently it was wet and cold. Flying is an interest of mine so we also connected there. 

I asked him to reach out and he did. I sent him a few books to read and he is. 

Remember there are people at the other end of the phone call or email; please be kind, lend a helping hand and just be nice to everyone. 

Also, please hire Roc. He's funny, silly and interesting. He would be teachable, coachable and he told me he'd even do an unpaid internship.
