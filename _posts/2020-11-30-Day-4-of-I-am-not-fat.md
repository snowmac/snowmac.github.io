This is probably the most I've ever blogged, but all the feedback in this crazy loop is good. People keep telling me they're proud of me and believe in me. I'm going to do it. 

I have to admit though, I've been tempted to eat off plan. What will a few blueberries hurt or another veggie? But my rigidness is keeping me on the plan. Sure the delux cheese burger at Wendy's yesterday sounded good, what sounded bad about fries (they're potatoes after all!), a coke and a big cheese burger? I'm drooling as I type this... but thats the problem, everything is wrong with it. It's SAD, it makes me FEEL sad. SAD = Standard American Diet. I'm tired of the diet... 

Yesterday, I took one of the giant sweet potatoes from Costco. Seriously they're like a pound EACH and the size of my ARM. I chopped them up with some small red potatoes, baked on 350 for 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was really hard not to add ANYTHING to them. Honestly, I'd be lying if I said they were GOOD. Again, blue berries, carrots and some curry all sound delightful to add to my dish... but alas I ate them, drank some sparkling water then hung out with the family. 

Today, I woke up before my baby at 7:00 am. What's this 7 am business? Anyways, I went to the bathroom and weighted in, I lost 1.5 pounds. 1.5 pounds? I'll take it. It was good to see I was still losing weight. Today, is day 4, the day Penn said is the hardest. It also happens to be a Monday, why did I pick my first day back to work after vacation, a monday, also to be the worst day of the diet? The day you should be in bed? I don't know. I'm silly that's why. But I got up, fed the wife, microwaved 6 petite potatoes and got a liter of water ready for my commute

# Enter Acupuncture

Acupuncture is a form of chinese medicine. It's also a lot of needles in your body. This was my intro appointment, so it made Monday much less bad. My appointment was an hour long and started at 9:30 AM, be 10-15 minutes early. I get there, after stuffing 6 baby potatoes in my belly, a liter of water and a Blonde christmas blend from Starbucks. It was awkward, tell this random stranger all the things wrong with you, lets talk about sex, bowel movements, and the list goes on and on and on. She offers a lot of good advice and I'm enjoying the conversation. I'm really good at getting lost in time, so this was perfect for me. 

I lie down, she sticks me with 40 tiny needles in my back and I take a 30 minute cat nap, remove them and apply to the front for another 30 minute nap. I slept, I was relaxed. I don't know if these work, or what working will look like, but I'm hopeful. 

At 12:00 my appointment is over, I head to the hippy grocery store to buy D3 as she recommended and get some lemons to have hot lemon water in the morning after I use the scale. Even the healthspan talks about lemons in the morning, so now it's lemon water and potatoes.... Scope creep, but hey I'm a software engineer. 

Time to get back to work; I'll see you tomorrow.
