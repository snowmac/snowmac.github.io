In the last 12 years of my career, I’ve talked to over 100 recruiters, probably closer to 1000. Everytime I decide it’s time to find a new job, I cast a wide net. My approach to finding a job is different from many. Rather than applying to specific jobs, I find recruiters and enlist their help in finding my next job. I’ve had a few jobs from applying directly, but most are found through my best career friend, the technical recruiter. Today we’re going to talk about truly passive income and how you as an engineer can market yourself to a wide pool of opportunities. Lets dig in. 

Passive income you say? Yes, you heard me. It’s all the rage, from stocks and dividends to real estate. Your resume is passive income, it generates income for you. Ok, Adam, time to put the coffee down and get back to reality. What do you mean? A resume is the number one socially acceptable way to brag about yourself. It's passive in the sense that you write it once, update it once in a while and it will generate millions of dollars of income potential for you over its lifetime. It costs nothing. It is the single most important asset to own. It’s typically the FIRST thing an employer sees of you. 

Notice I said potential. Stocks? Potential income. Stock Dividends? Potential income. Real estate? Potential income. All passive income takes work, ironic isn’t it? Passive income from stocks? You buy the asset and setup the stop loss parameters (buy more vs sell) and the reinvestment criteria. Same with dividends, you need to decide if you reinvest any dividends you get. Real estate is even more work, find the property, buy it, update it, list it or get a property management firm to manage it. After months of work you finally start getting income from a tenant, that may require you to dump thousands because the furnace broke or the toilet isn’t working. It’s a long term potential passive income. It takes a long time to see the result of the hard work with real estate, dividends, stocks or just about anything else. But your resume? Instant money. It’s easy money. It’s not free or without work. 

# How is a resume easy money? 

Your resume is a sales brochure. It tells the customer (employers) why you’re qualified for the job. It shows them that you have the demonstrated value over a consistent period of time. The resume is the single most important asset of your life. It’s worth more than your home, cars, jewelry or TVs. Unless you inherited a ton of money, it’s really important to your professional career. 

Do you get it yet? No? Ok. The resume goes out before you. It’s the first thing a recruiter or an employer will ask for. The first thing they see is your name typically, but the resume is next. The resume goes before you and says “HELLO WORLD! I’m ADAM BOURG. I CAN WRITE, I CAN COMMUNICATE, I AM SO GOOD AT MY JOB MY EMPLOYER GOT RICHER EMPLOYING ME”. Sounds egotistical doesn’t it? I don’t think so. It’s marketing. It communicates to the world that you can communicate, excel and produce value. 

# How do I make my asset (resume) work for me? 

You can’t throw many dollars at it like you can real estate or stocks. If you spend more than $1000 on resume edits and coaching you’re wasting your time and money. It doesn’t scale. More effort does not result in more sales. Focused effort makes the resume sell. 

# Focus point 1: Readability 

If everything is italic, bold or underlined then nothing is italic, bold or underlined. Meaning if everything is italic, it doesn’t make the resume easier to see important information. You want the target user / client to see the resume, quickly distill the info and make a quick yes or no decision on you. 

Tips:
* Lead with the title of the job, bold it. Eg, “Software Architect”
* Follow the title with an unbolded separated either through space or dash the dates employed. 
* Next line, put the employer’s name, location and employment type (if you switch between FTE and contracts)  in the next line in a slightly smaller font
* All your experience should be in bullet point format
* Finally, have a “Key Tech” or “Key Applications” or a “Key skills” section after the bullets to highlight specific skills you used in this role. For engineer’s it's going to be technology, for an account executive it will probably be leadership, management, workday and excel. 

# Focus point 2: Bullet contents

Bullet points should talk about your accomplishments. This is where you show value. I took xyz action with abc outcomes. Here are a few examples: 
* Created a CI/CD pipeline that continually deployed the application to production, we reduced our deployments from multi day processes to a deployment in just minutes. This reduced bugs and errors by over 90% saving the company thousands of hours every year. 
* Integrated our onboarding with Salesforce so every time a user signs up for our platform our customer service reps can be notified. This has resulted in a increase of user engagement by 50% and an increase of first time purchase within 30 days from 10% to 75% 
* Led a team of 6 engineers to built a new proof of concept in 3 months that resulted in the company getting the contract worth over $1,000,000 
Brought over a dozen legacy projects up to date in libraries, frameworks, and secured over 1000 vulnerabilities within existing applications

# Focus point 3: Don’t make up information

Sell yourself? Yes. Lie? No. You need to be truthful in your bullet points. Don’t make up stuff. If you can’t talk about specific measurable results, but you need something, talk about what you did, why it was important. For example, I can’t easily measure the compliance utilization of the platform. I know eventually everyone will use the compliance tool, but that’s not really a measurable or reportable outcome. It didn’t result in more income or sales, just made sure if we got sued, we’re covered, so a bullet like this is acceptable: 
* “Built a compliance tool to track contracts and agreements signed between the firm and all their contracted service providers.”. 

I can also report on testing I did and a mitigation plan I created: 
* “Conducted extensive scalability testing and mitigation to ensure the application can grow by 10x users” 

# Focus point 4: Have a professional summary at the to

This should talk about you, your experience and what you’re looking for. For example mine says: “I’m an expert in many web technologies and frameworks. I’ve been working with ReactJS and NodeJS for more than 8 years; collectively I have more than 12 years of professional development experience.” 

This section should highlight to an employer why you should be hired. Here I’m telling you I’m an expert. I am communicating my expertise. Could it be better? Yes. 

# Focus Point 5: Professionalism

Professionalism in your resume is not just about the content; it's also about how you present that content. This aspect covers everything from the language used to the format and design. A professional resume reflects a professional candidate. Here’s how to ensure your resume embodies professionalism:

1. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a uniform font size, type, and color scheme throughout your resume. This consistency shows attention to detail. For example, if you're using a 12-point Arial font for your main text, stick with it throughout the document.
Language and Tone: Use formal, yet approachable language. Avoid slang and overly casual phrases. Instead, opt for clear, concise, and professional wording. For instance, instead of saying, “I was the go-to person for fixing code bugs,” say, “Recognized for expertise in identifying and resolving coding errors.”
2. **Error-Free Content**: Proofread your resume multiple times to eliminate grammatical errors and typos. These mistakes can be a major turn-off for recruiters and might imply a lack of thoroughness. This is something I could really improve on. 
3. **Quantifiable Achievements**: Wherever possible, use numbers and data to quantify your achievements. For example, “Increased website traffic by 30% through SEO optimization” is more impactful than “Improved website traffic through SEO.”
4. **Confidentiality**: Be mindful of confidentiality and proprietary information. Avoid mentioning details about your current or past employers that are not public knowledge.

With these ideas you can take your resume to the next level. If you need resume help or coaching, please reach out to me. Adam dot Bourg {at} GMAIL dot com or on LinkedIn.
