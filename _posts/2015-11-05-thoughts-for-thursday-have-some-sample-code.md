Code is like a living resume. You are constantly changing and learning, or at least I hope you are. If you&#8217;re a developer, you may never know when you might be out of a job, so just like it&#8217;s a great idea to keep your resume up to date, I highly recommend keeping some sample code around.

I don&#8217;t know how many times I get asked by a recruiter every time I go looking for a job if I have any samples. The answer is always no, and often I get passed up for the guy who does have code and contributes to open source.

But I don&#8217;t have time?&#8211; I used to think that, but after a couple of coding interviews, I took their ideas, things like a color picker and composed my own <a href="https://github.com/snowmac/code_samples" target="_blank">github repo</a> containing samples I&#8217;d be proud to put my name on.

You don&#8217;t have to update very often, I would build a couple of demo apps. Stuff that you&#8217;d be proud to say, &#8220;I did this&#8221;. It could be a simple color picker in HTML 5 and Javascript, or it could be a Todo List application in Rails and SQLlite with Rspec tests. Try to show the picture of, if youÂ paid me, here&#8217;s what I could deliver.
