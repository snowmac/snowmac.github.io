When I was 13, I started to have a fascination with how the money markets work. I wanted to be like Warren Buffett. So I read all sorts of books on investments, hedge funds, planning and money management. That propelled my interest into business and accounting in college, where I quickly grew bored and focused on web development all the time between classes. I eventually dropped business went for comp sci and still felt really bored because I love web development and everything to do with the web. It's what I do now, it's what I really enjoy. But money management and knowing about strategies and ways to grow money, build businesses and the like have not left me but only grown. Today we're going to be exploring a hyperfixation of mine: AI investing.

# AI Investing

Why invest in AI? It's like the dot com boom baby, we're all going to get rich, spend stupid amounts on stocks that will disappear overnight and blow a lot of money doing it. Hopefully we'll cash in profits and get rich like those Crypto nerds, but we will see.

How do I invest in AI? Skills and stocks. This is not a skills post. It's all about stocks.

# Non AI stocks

Just a brief list of what I have that is NOT AI related. I have purchased some of the following
