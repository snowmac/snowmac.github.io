Research published in early 2015 found that globally unemployment caused 45,000 suicides per year. I am getting emotional just writing this because it’s just so sad and it’s not right. There is so much written and spoken material in the Western World around what we should strive for and who we should be. Personally I don’t have a PHD, I haven’t undertaken 20 years of research and I’m not a billionaire – so if that’s your criteria for success and or credibility, no need to read this layman’s “Pub Wisdom.”
