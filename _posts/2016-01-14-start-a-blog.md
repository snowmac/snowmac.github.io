While I don&#8217;t blog the most consistently, certainly the holidays didn&#8217;t help. I have recently discovered that I really like writing, getting to express myself in the written form has been liberating. Listening to a guy like the Simple Programmer has inspired me to think of what I could do with my career through my blog. I could start my own training program for new programmers, I could tutor more and I could even speak at a conference. Honing my skills and grammar will allow me to write a book &#8220;some day soon&#8221;.

I encourage everyone to start a blog, even if your writing sucks. Blogging is fun, its engaging and challenging. You have to express your ideas clearly and articulate yourself. Give it a try today!
